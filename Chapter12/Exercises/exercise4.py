"""
Edsgar Dijkstra is known for his work on programming languages. He
came up with a neat problem that he called the Dutch National Flag
problem: given a list of strings, each of which is either 'red' , 'green' , or 'blue'
(each is repeated several times in the list), rearrange the list so that the
strings are in the order of the Dutch national flagâ€”all the 'red' strings
first, then all the 'green' strings, then all the 'blue' strings.

Write a function called dutch_flag that takes a list and solves this problem.
